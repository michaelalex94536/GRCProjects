#### ASK_Tx_simulator
"ASK_Tx_simulator" shows how to modulate a carrier with digital data using amplitude-shift keying (ASK). 

In this example we have 4 different amplitude levels as seen in the time domain signals, as well as the constellation plot.  Yes, the zero baseline shows up as well, but I'm not counting that...
