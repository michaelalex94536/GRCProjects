## Attn_measure

### Introduction
"Attn_measure" shows how to measure the attenuation of an in-line attenuator with the Pluto.  As seen in the photograph below, the attenuators used here (blue, barrel-shaped device in the upper-right portion of the figure) had SMA connectors that allowed them to be easily connected between the Tx and Rx SMA connectors of the Pluto using short SMA cables.  I used three attenuators made by a company called Mini-Circuits with attenuation values of 3dB, 8dB, and 10dB stamped on their bodies. Since the attenuators can be connected in series, I measured the Pluto Tx to Rx power loss for ideal attenuation values of 3dB, 8dB, 10dB, 11dB, 13dB, 18dB, and 21dB.

From the constellation plot below, we see the 0's and 1's are distinguishable, even in the presence of moderate noise.
