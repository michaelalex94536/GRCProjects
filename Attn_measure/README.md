#### Attn_measure
"Attn_measure" shows how to demodulate on-off-keying (OOK) data by mixing the modulated signal with the carrier signal.  No external hardware needed.   

The baseband signal has 24-bits (0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0).

From the constellation plot below, we see the 0's and 1's are distinguishable, even in the presence of moderate noise.
