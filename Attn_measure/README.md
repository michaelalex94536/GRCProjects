#### Attn_measure
"Attn_measure" shows how to measure the attenuation of an in-line attenuator with the Pluto.  As seen in the photograph below, the attenuator (blue, barrel-shaped device in the upper-right portion of the figure) has SMA connectors that allow it to be easily connected between the Tx and Rx SMA connectors of the Pluto using short SMA cables.

Figure 1    Attenuator connected in-line between the Tx and Rx SMA connectors of the Pluto. This unit has been hacked to add additional Rx and Tx channels.

From the constellation plot below, we see the 0's and 1's are distinguishable, even in the presence of moderate noise.
