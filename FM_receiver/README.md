"FM_receiver_basic" shows how to use an RTL-SDR dongle to demodulate and listen to a single, user-selected FM radio station using the PC speaker.  This project uses the GRC wide band FM demodulator (WBFM Receive) block.  The user selects the FM station frequency using a slider.  Various time- and frequency-domain signals are displayed.
