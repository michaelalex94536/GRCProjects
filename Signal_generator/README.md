#### Signal_generator
In this flowgraph, we use the GRC Signal Source block to create a complex signal with a frequency of the user's choosing, and display it in the time- and frequency-domains.  We also take the conjugate of the complex signal and add it to itself, eliminating the complex portion of the signal, leaving only a real signal.  We also display real signal in the time- and frequency domains.
