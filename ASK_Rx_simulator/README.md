#### ASK_Rx_simulator
"ASK_Rx_simulator" shows how to demodulate on-off-keying (ASK) data by mixing the modulated signal with the carrier signal.  No external hardware needed.  The constellation plot shows we have 4 clusters of signals - the 4 diffferent amplitudes of the baseband ASK data with additive noise.
