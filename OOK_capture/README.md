#### OOK_capture
"OOK_capture" shows how to use an RTL-SDR dongle to display OOK signals from a very old garage door opener, in this case one having a carrier frequency of approximately 390 MHz. The user should set the appropriate frequency for their device (it's usually written on the device somewhere), and don't forget to use an antenna with the SDR dongle. The time and frequency domain OOK signals are displayed, along with the constellation plot, which is pretty simple in this case. We also compute the magnitude of the complex time domain signal, decimate it, and show it in the time domain - allowing us to clearly see the 0's and 1's that were transmitted. The decimated signal is also sent to an audio sink - the PC speaker - so we can hear the bursts generated when the garage door opener button is pushed.  Finally, there is a file sink block in case the user wants to save the captured IQ data. In addition to an RTL-SDR dongle (or other hardware) for signal capture, the user will need a garage door opener or key fob to generate the OOK signals. Note: depending on receiver gain settings and distance from the key fob to the receiver, the received signal may saturate or clip. And when logging the data to a file, please note the file can get very large very quickly.
