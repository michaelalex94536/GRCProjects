#### OOK_Tx_simulator
"OOK_Tx_simulator" shows how to modulate a carrier with digital data using on-off-keying.  No external hardware needed.   The alarming thing seen here is how wide the spectrum is!  

The baseband signal has 24-bits (0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0).  Here is the digital and transmitted data:
